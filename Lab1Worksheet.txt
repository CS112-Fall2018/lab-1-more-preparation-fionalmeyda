Lab 1 Worksheet

1. What if 12 bits were used to store a signed integer. What is the biggest/smallest possible integer? -2048 to 2047
	

2. Think about possible values and their range, say what type of variable would be suitable for the following, and suggest a name for it too. 

For example: the temperature of a room in degrees Fahrenheit. Room temperature is likely to vary between say 50 degrees F and 100 degrees F,  but it can take any value in between including non-integers, e.g 71.19 F, so the type must be float or double depending on the accuracy required. A suitable variable name would be roomTemp. 


(i) The number of pages in a book; type =  int // Variable name would be bookPages.

(ii) The number of atoms in a book; type= long // variable name = bookAtoms

(iii) The length of a side of a triangle in inches; type = float // variable name = lengthTriangle

(iv) Your name; type= string // variable name= yourName

(v) Whether or not a nucleus has decayed; type = boolean // variable name : nucleusDecayed

(vi) The probability that it could have decayed. Type = float // variable name =probabilityDecayed 

3. Start to do a little java programming! 
	Follow the example of the Hello.java program and do some testing of Java int and float.
	Write a short class called “Arithmetic” that in its main method does the following:

		Creates 4 local variables
			Two ints (call them a and b)
			Two floats (call them x and y)
		Performs the following arithmetic operations on every combination of two of these 
		and output using System.out.println each of the results
			Addition
			Division (in both directions)
